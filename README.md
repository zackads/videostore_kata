Write a system that can build a statement, when given rentals.

When there are 3 regular movie rentals for 1, 2 and 3 days respectively, the statement looks like:

```
Rental Record for Customer Name
  Crazynotes  2.0
  Teeth  2.0
  The Web  3.5
You owe 7.5
You earned 3 frequent renter points
```

## Regular Movies

Are 2 for the first 2 days, and 1.5 for each day thereafter.

You earn 1 frequent renter point no matter the length of the rental.

```python
class RegularMovie:
    def __init__(self, name):
        name = name

    def calculate_cost(days_rental):
        # ...

    def calculate_points(days_rental):
        return 1
```

## New Release Movies

Are 3 per day.

You earn 1 frequent renter point for a 1 day rental, and 2 for any rental of 2 days or more.

```python
class NewReleaseMovie:
    def __init__(self, name):
        name = name

    def calculate_cost(days_rental):
        return 3 * days_rental

    def calculate_points(days_rental):
        return days_rental == 1 ? 1 : 2
```

## Childrens Movies

Are 1.5 for the first 3 days, and 1.5 for each day thereafter.

You earn 1 frequent renter point no matter the length of the rental.

```python
class NewReleaseMovie:
    def __init__(self, name):
        name = name

    def calculate_cost(days_rental):
        # ...

    def calculate_points(_):
        return 1
```
